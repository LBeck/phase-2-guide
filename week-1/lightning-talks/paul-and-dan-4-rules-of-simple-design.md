1. All tests pass
1. Minimize duplication
1. Maximize Clarity
1. Have as few elements as possible

These can sound contradictory. Sometimes you have to add parts in order to
increase clarity. Consider these like a hierarchy. 

1. Before worrying about small code, make sure it passes the tests, has little
   duplication, and is very clear.
1. Before worrying about maximizing clarity, make sure the tests pass and there
   is not duplication.
1. Before worrying about duplication, make sur ethe tests pass.

## Why?

1. We make sure the tests pass so we know the software does what it is supposed
   to
1. We minimize duplication to decrease complexity.
1. We maximize clarity because the majority of the cost is in understanding and
   maintenance.
1. We have as few elements as possible to keep things simple
