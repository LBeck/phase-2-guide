# Semantic Markup - Steven Nugent

1. It's about using your HTML for meaning and markup
1. There used to be tags like "center" and "b", but those are formatting tags
1. Instead, use CSS to change your format
## Why?

1. Accessibility. Screen readers work better with markup that doesn't concern
   itself with formatting
1. Good structure makes things work better across browsers

## How?

1. Look for tags which describe your markup (article, nav, head, tbody, etc.)
1. Using classes or names can get really confusing really fast
1. Insead use article

## TL/DR - Use HTML for Information, NOT Style or Layout

1. Make your HTML tags purposeful and meaningful
1. Have your CSS care about layout and design
