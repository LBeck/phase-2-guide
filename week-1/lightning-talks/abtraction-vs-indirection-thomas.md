##Abstraction vs Indirection

* **Abstraction**: is the idea. For example if you are discussing Books you can just talk about their title, ISDN, checked out, etc. You don't need to know about all the words in the book. Abstraction is reduction of complexity. 

* **Indirection** factor out common functionality. Reduce decoupling.
