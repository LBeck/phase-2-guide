## Touch Events By Steven

* Similar to Mouse Events
* Set an event listener for the following
  * touch_start
  * touch_end
  * touch_move
  * touch_cancel

* Using touch_move, you must be sure to `preventDefault()` to avoid scrolling

* Need to use `x=event.targetTouches[0].pagex`

## How to view and try out?

* Can push to heroku then browse to it on your phone. 
* Can use a phone emulator
* Can access your [localhost directly from your phone](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3132105/how-do-you-access-a-website-running-on-localhost-from-iphone-browser).
