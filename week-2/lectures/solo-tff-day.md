##SOLO TFD DAY
Taken from the popular (and sometimes necessary) AFD (alcohol free day) idea, a TFD (testing free day) is useful when you just need to focus your learning on specific topics and not on building a full tested web app.

* Welcome to your **TFD**

1. [Learning Objectives](#learning-objectives)
1. [Instructions](#instructions)



## Learning Objectives
Solidify your learning on one or more of your week 1 and week 2 learning objectives.  **Ignore all testing**
* Take the time to work solo and accurately assess your learning and knowledge. 

## Instructions
* Choose a challenge below based on it's learning objectives. 
* Journal your learning - discuss how your code / coding process illustrates each objective.

1. Challenge : [RESTful CRUD](http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/challenges/395)

1. Challenge : [Active Record](http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/challenges/390)
1. Challenge : [Authentication and Authorization](http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/challenges/391)
1. Challenge : [Validations - Server to Client](http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/challenges/398)
1. Challenge : [Client Server Scoping](http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/challenges/399)
1. Challenge : [CSS Layout](http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/challenges/392)  
  * I can clearly explain the two different roles that HTML and CSS play
  * I use [semantic markup](http://www.webstyleguide.com/wsg3/5-site-structure/2-semantic-markup.html)to separate my visual presentation from my document structure  
  * I've added a stylesheet to a web page  
  * I've applied styles via tag name, id, and class  
  * I can clearly explain the different css box models  
  * I've built a simple two column layout  
  * I've applied styles based on
  [pseudo-selectors](http://css-tricks.com/pseudo-class-selectors/) and/or
  [child and sibling](http://css-tricks.com/child-and-sibling-selectors/)
   selectors  
  * I've used [CSS3 transitions](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/css-fundametals-css-3-transitions/)
  * I'm comfortable using the different css `position` and `display` formats.  
1. Challenge : [AJAX and jQuery](http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/challenges/400)
  * I can use jQuery to retrieve elements from the DOM using CSS selectors  
  * I can bind events to elements I've pulled from the DOM  
  * I can trigger events on elements I've pulled from the DOM  
1. Challenge : [JavaScript Dynamic Elements and Events](http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/challenges/395)
  * I use jQuery to implement Event Delegation with the `on` function  
  * I separate my view concerns from my data verification concerns  
  * I use AJAX to retrieve partials from the server and replace or append
   them to a website  
  * I use AJAX to retrieve JSON from the server and then modify the page based on the JSON  
  * I use MustacheJS or underscores templating library to convert JSON to HTML  
1. Challenge : [OO JS Racer](http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/challenges/297)
  * I notice when there are errors in the JavaScript console, and fix those before debugging further.  
  * I use the console to write small snippets of code to validate my assumptions  
  * I can find where my code is in a stacktrace.
  * I use `console.log` to investigate the JavaScript applications state  
  * I can define variables that contain Strings, Numbers, functions and object literals  
  * I am comfortable passing functions as arguments to other functions  
  * I use the `var` keyword to prevent variables from entering the global scope  
  * I can iterate over arrays and objects  
  * I can use [objects literals](http://teamtreehouse.  com/library/websites/javascript-foundations/objects/basic-objects) as key-value pairs  
  * I group similar javascript functions into objects  
  * I write functions which take functions as an argument  
  * I use the [module pattern](http://www.adequatelygood.com/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth.html) to keep my functions and variables out of the global scope  
  * I can use prototypes and the new keyword  
  * I can accurately trace what [this](http://trephine.org/t/index.php?title=Understanding_JavaScript%27s_this_keyword) will be in most instances
  * I can mix in objects into my objects prototypes to add behavior
