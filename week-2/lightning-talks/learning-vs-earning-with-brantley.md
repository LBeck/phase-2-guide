# Learning Vs Earning
There's a time to learn and a time to earn.

## Venture Backed Startup
1. $5m for 33% of the company
2. It's worth $15m because $5 x 1 / 3
3. If it has 30 companies, each person gets 0.25% equity YAY!
4. Acquired for $50m
5. Each person earns 125K.
6. If it takes 4 years, its 125/4  == $31k
7. And it's taxed as short term capital gains
8. So you wind up with ~18K/yr in earnings.
9. And this is the 'best possible outcome.' Most startups fail
10. ~1500 IPOs or Acquisitions of Venture Backed Companies
11. 5% exit between $5 and $50 million
12. .05% exit for  $150m

So you likely won't make your lifes money working for a startup that exits
successfuly.
