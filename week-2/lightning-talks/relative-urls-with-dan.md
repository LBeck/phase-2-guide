# Relative and Absolute paths with Dan

I made a pretty website which applied the CSS on the home page, but the /edit
page didn't work!

This was because my css link looked like `styles/stylesheet`

## 3 kinds of paths
1. Full absolute path i.e. `http://google.com/stylesheets/style.css`
2. Domain absolute path i.e. `/stylesheets/style.css`
3. Relative paths i.e. `stylesheets/style.css`
