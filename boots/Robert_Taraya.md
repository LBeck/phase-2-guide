w3-d1: this mornings challenge was omniauth-twitter. so frustrating! docs sucked ass. i think life after dbc i'm gonna work through a lot of these challenges over again and blog about the process...there needs to be better written tutorials out there! lol. new groups...couldn't be happier! i like working with steven cuz he's awesome and we always flow. whenever i pair with annie i always learn a ton!!! so i'm happy to be working with her. ryan is cool...haven't worked with him too much so far so it will be great to get to know him better. instead of thinking of a project idea first, we decided to list all the things we needed to work on or wanted more practice on, then we created a project around those things. so far seems to have been a good move. as the "senior" guy on the team i remember how it was to only have a week left in the phase and feeling shaky in some/most of the new technologies introduced to in this phase. so i'm all for putting the teams learning above wanting to build something cool...or useful for that matter.

w2-d6/7: this was portolio challenge weekend. drank too much coffee this saturday morning/afternoon. got a lot done after a long day. sunday was great too. really productive inspired by daniel's solution for conway's game of life. i wanna do that too! salar convinced me to do js racer p1. glad i took his advice and did it. got a lot of good js/jquery event handler practice. motivated to tackle type racer on my own.

w2-d5: solo day! yay! i worked on the css challenge thinking i could breeze through it and then tackle another, but noooo! it took me the whole time working on that one problem. i hacked at it the whole time, but got it to look pretty similar. today spent most of our group time reproducing yesterdays work. lost all the js code in one file. boo! marion and i butted heads a little this evening. started working on portfolio challenges this evening. doin well.

w2-d4: ajax was a little but of a struggle for me today cuz i didn't know what i was doing. lol...cricket was playing mr. socrates trying to lead me to an answer with his leading questions...but i had no clue. gary and i worked through a few of our projects features but screwed up when committing files to github. damn! are we every gonna have a project without git troubles?!

w2-d3: worked with jquery today, and that was fun. i feel pretty comfortable with basic event listeners and bindings. i skipped out on ee today. i felt bad cuz i didn't want to abandon the group, but i also didn't want to do f-word again...cuz i know how deep that rabbit hole can go, and i know that if i just did it just to participate that i would do it half assed and it would be ingenuous so i just decided to skip out. sorry gopher snakes!

w2-d2: challenge for the morning was organge tree using oojs. thomas and i did pretty well working through level 1, and slowly got through prototypes in level 2 before lunch. i need to do this over again from the beginning so that i get more practice with prototypes and oojs. projects moving along. i hope choosing the canvas project instead of type racer wasn't a mistake...i really want to get more experience with js.

w2-d1: worked the game of life again, but this time in js and jasmine. struggled during the first sitting, got better on the second, and event better on the third. started new projects this afternoon. worked with steven. we had good momentum and got some good spikes goin.

w1-d6/7: i got a lot done on saturday. not so much on sunday.

w1-d5:
tgif! read through thunder this morining...wondering why i wasnt reading this all week long. awesome stuff. tonight: beer and coding...always fun...just ask zee lol.

w1-d4:
felt good today. drank a lot of coffee around dinner, which gave me a lot of energy to power through some coding till past midnight. gary and i went over sinatra-todo over and over again switching drivers every 10 mins with a 1 hr timebox. repeated the exercise switching drivers every 5 mins. for another hr. was a great exercise for thinking and coding faster.

w1-d3:
had a great day of programming with the group. went home early tonight. needed to catch up on some rest. was planning on going home and reading, but ended up just going to bed early. nice.

w1-d2:
worked on finishing challenge with annie tonight. then went home.

w1-d1:
i need to review the git workflow, so i can work with confidence. got caught up reading a lot of differnet stuff online tonight, but now leaving dbc feeling like i didn't accomplish anything.

### The Thumb System

Each learning objective has a series of behaviors or questions that you can use
to gauge where you sit on the thumb system. It's by no means comprehensive; and
is intended as a starting point for assessing your comprehension and competence.

* 1 thumb up indicates you're competent enough to be somewhat useful and able to
  work in it independently
* 2 means you're comfortable with the topic, and are actually productive in it
* 3 means you are zomg wtf amazi-craze you just tear through code in that topic
