### The Thumb System

Each learning objective has a series of behaviors or questions that you can use
to gauge where you sit on the thumb system. It's by no means comprehensive; and
is intended as a starting point for assessing your comprehension and competence.

* 1 thumb up indicates you're competent enough to be somewhat useful and able to
  work in it independently
* 2 means you're comfortable with the topic, and are actually productive in it
* 3 means you are zomg wtf amazi-craze you just tear through code in that topic
