Week 1 Day 1 Monday

| Coders Mindset |  Testing & TDD |  Debugging | Ruby Webapps | ActiveRecord | HTML & CSS |
|----------------|----------------|------------|--------------|--------------|------------|
|      0         |       0        |    0       |       0      |      +0.5    |    0       |

Monday is dead to me. I kinda get how sinatra works but maybe not.

Week 1 Day 2 Tuesday

| Coders Mindset |	Testing & TDD |	Debugging |	Ruby Webapps | ActiveRecord	| HTML & CSS |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------|
|      +0.5      |       +1       |    +0.5   |     +0       |    +0.5      |    +0.25   |
Everything today went waaaayyy better than Monday. I feel like I'm starting to at least
have a decent idea and grasp on what the hell we're doing and when I talk about anything.
I'm not doing great at any one thing but I also don't feel completely lost with any one thing.
Rspec is growing on me and I'm digging how simple and how much Active Record does for us.
I think I could mess with HTML/CSS a little more if I really wanted to get fancy with presentation.

Week 1 Day 3 Wednesday

| Coders Mindset |	Testing & TDD |	Debugging |	Ruby Webapps | ActiveRecord	| HTML & CSS |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------|
|      +0.5      |       +1       |    +0.5   |     +.5      |    +0.5      |    +0.25   |
Today went well. Didn't have any crazy breakthroughs or feel super better about any one thing
but I do feel better about having gotten a lot more practice and exposure to all of our tools.
I also got to play with RSPEC a bit which is actually turning out to be kinda fun to write 
my own tests so I'm looking forward to try and do more TDD.

Week 1 Day 4 Thursday

| Coders Mindset |	Testing & TDD |	Debugging |	Ruby Webapps | ActiveRecord	| HTML & CSS |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------|
|      +0.5      |       +2       |    +1     |     +.5      |    +1        |    +0      |
Today was alright. TDD was tough to get into but after I got into it I enjoyed going back and
forth. I feel better about testing generally but I think writiing good tests is still pretty
tough. I feel a little better about Active Record and sinatra but wish I would've had some more
time during the day to try some more HTML/CSS with my group. 

Week 2 Day 1 Monday

| Coders Mindset |	Testing & TDD |	Debugging |	Ruby Webapps | ActiveRecord	| HTML & CSS |

Not a bad day. beat my head against javascript for a while and still don't know much but it
isn't so discouraging. I'm looking forward to getting better at it and doing some cool things 
with it in our group projects for type racer. 

Week 2 Day 3 Wednesday

Things are going alright. Haven't been too productive in the nights after group projects but 
I feel like I'm getting to flex my skills and learn a lot from the morning challenges and
from what I'm learning and doing in my group project.

Week 2 Day 5 Friday

| Coders Mindset |	Testing & TDD |	Debugging |	Ruby Webapps | ActiveRecord	| HTML & CSS |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------|
|      0.5      |       -1       |    +1     |      +0       |       +1     |    +0      |

Friday was alright. The morning was nice to solo and have the opportunity to try and check
out and go through exercises for things we may not have gotten to during the week but I 
tried to tackle bcrypt and that was really tough. On the bright side our group project
actually went really well and I had a ton of fun working all week with my group on type
racer and am really proud to have had a nice finished product at the end of the week.

Week 3 Day 1 Monday

| Coders Mindset |	Testing & TDD |	Debugging |	Ruby Webapps | ActiveRecord	| HTML & CSS |

Monday has been ok. Oauth is cool/confusing. I'm excited about group projects, I love music
and I'm super stoked to be working on a music app with some cool people I haven't gotten to
work with much yet. Hopefully I'll catch up with some of the learning gaps I have from the 
past 2 weeks.
