Everything today went waaaayyy better than Monday. I feel like I'm starting to at least
have a decent idea and grasp on what the hell we're doing and when I talk about anything.
I'm not doing great at any one thing but I also don't feel completely lost with any one thing.
Rspec is growing on me and I'm digging how simple and how much Active Record does for us.
I think I could mess with HTML/CSS a little more if I really wanted to get fancy with presentation.
