Monday is dead to me. I kinda get how sinatra works but maybe not.

Week 1 Day 2 Tuesday

| Coders Mindset |	Testing & TDD |	Debugging |	Ruby Webapps | ActiveRecord	| HTML & CSS |

|      +0.5      |       +1       |    +0.5   |     +0       |    +0.5      |    +0.25   |
Everything today went waaaayyy better than Monday. I feel like I'm starting to at least
have a decent idea and grasp on what the hell we're doing and when I talk about anything.
I'm not doing great at any one thing but I also don't feel completely lost with any one thing.
Rspec is growing on me and I'm digging how simple and how much Active Record does for us.
I think I could mess with HTML/CSS a little more if I really wanted to get fancy with presentation.

Week 1 Day 3 Wednesday

| Coders Mindset |	Testing & TDD |	Debugging |	Ruby Webapps | ActiveRecord	| HTML & CSS |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------|
|      +0.5      |       +1       |    +0.5   |     +.5      |    +0.5      |    +0.25   |
Today went well. Didn't have any crazy breakthroughs or feel super better about any one thing
but I do feel better about having gotten a lot more practice and exposure to all of our tools.
I also got to play with RSPEC a bit which is actually turning out to be kinda fun to write 
my own tests so I'm looking forward to try and do more TDD.

Week 1 Day 4 Thursday

| Coders Mindset |	Testing & TDD |	Debugging |	Ruby Webapps | ActiveRecord	| HTML & CSS |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|------------|
|      +0.5      |       +2       |    +1     |     +.5      |    +1        |    +0      |
Today was alright. TDD was tough to get into but after I got into it I enjoyed going back and
forth. I feel better about testing generally but I think writiing good tests is still pretty
tough. I feel a little better about Active Record and sinatra but wish I would've had some more
time during the day to try some more HTML/CSS with my group.
