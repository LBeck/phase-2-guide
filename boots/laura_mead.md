## Self Evaluation Card

Spend a few minutes every day thinking about how you're doing with the weeks
learning objectives:

2. Indicate where you feel you stand in each of the learning objectives.
   (use an [emoji](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) for :+1: :gem:!)
3. Add a tweet-sized blurb about what you learned today.

3. I figured out how to push a Sinatra file to Heroku.  Couldn't tell you what any of it means
but I was able to do it?  So that was cool.  Still feel pretty stuck on everything else though.
There just don't seem to be enough time in the day to learn everything.
