Today, I learnt how to integreate Rspec into Sinatra (http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/how-to-integrate-rspec-into-a-sinatra-app/). However, up until now I have not done any Rspec and so I need to do an actual tutorial on the syntax etc. of Rspec.


Also, I learnt basics of how to deal with Forks and Merges in GitHub.


Corders Mindset: 
I am improving every day, but still lots of ways to go.

Testing & TDD: 
So far still no actual clue. Will do the tuts now and hope to get a better understanding then.

Debugging: 
So much to learn but am improving every day. 

Ruby Webapps: 
Not much I know here. I have done the Singing with Sinatra tutorial (parts 1 and 2) but that's about it.

Active Record: 
Feeling okay so far.

HTML & CSS: 
Love.
