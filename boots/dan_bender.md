Today, I learnt how to integreate Rspec into Sinatra (http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/how-to-integrate-rspec-into-a-sinatra-app/). However, up until now I have not done any Rspec and so I need to do an actual tutorial on the syntax etc. of Rspec.


Also, I learnt basics of how to deal with Forks and Merges in GitHub.


Corders Mindset: 
I am improving every day, but still lots of ways to go.

Testing & TDD: 
So far still no actual clue. Will do the tuts now and hope to get a better understanding then.

Debugging: 
So much to learn but am improving every day. 

Ruby Webapps: 
Not much I know here. I have done the Singing with Sinatra tutorial (parts 1 and 2) but that's about it.

Active Record: 
Feeling okay so far.

HTML & CSS: 
Love.

Today, I spent a lot of time with Rspec tutorials. They helped me, "the fog is sloooowly lifting".
We built a note-taking app and deployed it to Heroku and built our release one from scratch. Did not get it on Heroku unfortunately, need to look into Heroku and Postgres.


Corders Mindset: 
I am improving every day, but still lots of ways to go.

Testing & TDD: 
Getting an idea of the Syntax of Rspec. Obviously, I can see the reasons for using it. Sometimes difficult to decide WHAT to test for.

Debugging: 
Today, I felt like I did a pretty good job at debugging (except Heroku).

Ruby Webapps: 
Built and deployed the note-taking app (morning challenge). Team Schnitzel 

Active Record: 
Feeling okay so far.

HTML & CSS: 
Love. We took the time to apply some markup and styles to our release 1!
