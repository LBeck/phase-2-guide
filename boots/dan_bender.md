Phase 2 Day 1

Today, I learnt how to integreate Rspec into Sinatra (http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/how-to-integrate-rspec-into-a-sinatra-app/). However, up until now I have not done any Rspec and so I need to do an actual tutorial on the syntax etc. of Rspec.


Also, I learnt basics of how to deal with Forks and Merges in GitHub.


Corders Mindset:
I am improving every day, but still lots of ways to go.

Testing & TDD:
So far still no actual clue. Will do the tuts now and hope to get a better understanding then.

Debugging:
So much to learn but am improving every day.

Ruby Webapps:
Not much I know here. I have done the Singing with Sinatra tutorial (parts 1 and 2) but that's about it.

Active Record:
Feeling okay so far.

HTML & CSS:
Love.

Today, I spent a lot of time with Rspec tutorials. They helped me, "the fog is sloooowly lifting".
We built a note-taking app and deployed it to Heroku and built our release one from scratch. Did not get it on Heroku unfortunately, need to look into Heroku and Postgres.


Corders Mindset:
I am improving every day, but still lots of ways to go.

Testing & TDD:
Getting an idea of the Syntax of Rspec. Obviously, I can see the reasons for using it. Sometimes difficult to decide WHAT to test for.

Debugging:
Today, I felt like I did a pretty good job at debugging (except Heroku).

Ruby Webapps:
Built and deployed the note-taking app (morning challenge). Team Schnitzel

Active Record:
Feeling okay so far.

HTML & CSS:
Love. We took the time to apply some markup and styles to our release 1!

Use require instead.

This _relative made us – Team Schnitzel – rewrite the first release of our app. Twice.

require './our_app'
run Sinatra::Application
# `run` is a method that tells the rack server
# to dispatch HTTP Requests to the rack specified.


Also, Heroku runs on Postgresql, so why not use PG in development too? We did that in our latest rewrite and it worked nicely.

Release 01 is simple, but we sure as hell learned a looot.

Today, I fell for TDD. We tdd'ed our way through the beginnings of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life, switched pairing partners a bunch of times, deleted everything we had written and started from scratch. Awesome.

Team Schnitzel implemented TDD, too. Sick.

Evening lecture by @quackingduck was inspiring as hell:

"Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together."
– Unix philosophy

WEEKEND:

I built release 1 of Craigslist Jr. Took me a while, but learned a lot and felt okay about doing it. Hope to find time for release 2 during the week. Also, I worked through the JS labs on Socrates.

Friday night, I wanted to try sth new in CSS 3 and this is what I built, a ruby in pure CSS, made out of two divs: http://blog.danbender.net/post/63866309094/css-experiment-a-css-only-ruby
F'ing love pseudo selectors!

MONDAY:

Braindead. Last week I was sick and I didn't sleep much. Guess this lack of sleep caught up to me finally. After class I was staring at the screen trying to do some more JS work but gave up around 10 pm. Went home as an angry, frustrated, brainless zombie, wanting to feast on 'em livin. And stuff.

TUESDAY:

Great day. Morning challenge was great and actually, all in all, felt surprisingly okay about Jasmine (so far have not looked at it much) and JS.Group project progressed nicely and we have an MVP online: http://starwarsracer.herokuapp.com/  Excited to do more. Typeracer = funnsies!
After class, I finally caught up on Treehouse and I like the lectures.

Btw. I pretty much don't update the emojis because

I am beginning to grasp the power of JS. I love playing with it and feel relatively comfortable reading and writing it. Generally, expressing my thoughts/ breaking down stuff (coder's mindset) is improving every day. I have not yet spent too much time with testing unfortunately, so I am shaky on the syntax but felt okay doing the challenges that involved Jasmine so far. Debugging JS is going ok – thanks to console and dev tools in Chrome and Firebug in FF.
JS for webapps: Love team orphan_snakes and our product. Having a great time and learning a shitload. Today, Zee gave us a lightspeed intro to cleaning up our JS code into "OOP js". Also, we finished our algorithm/ logic on calculating accuracy and comparing user input and the given text file. gTomorrow: testing and refactor and adding the StarWars intro crawl I built.
