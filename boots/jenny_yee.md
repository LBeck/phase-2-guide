**PHASE TWO**

*WEEK ONE*

*MONDAY*

I'm just opening myself to learning, feeling really overwhelmed right now.

*TUESDAY*
Feeling a little better about how things are working together but still haven't seen something work end-to-end. 
Looking forward to pushing to heroku tonight!

*WEDNESDAY*
A slow day. Was able to push to Heroku last night, worked on validations this morning. Starting to
piece together postgres. Slow going and I'm dealing with waves of feeling overwhelmed that I'm not able to pick up 
all the pieces fast enough to be able to build these things on my own.

*THURSDAY*
- Miles spoke tonight about composition and literacy, espousing the virtues of the Unix philosohpy of
"Write programs that do one thing and do it well." 
- Last night, I tried to read over Thunder. 
- AM we covered rspec and testing which was super helpful. 
- PM we got our app on Heroku - our first feature is working, the second feature isn't. Will have to debug tomorrow.
- Tonight I plan to build a lightweight app and practice rspec testing as I go along.
