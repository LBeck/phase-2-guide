I'm just opening myself to learning, feeling really overwhelmed right now.

Feeling a little better about how things are working together but still haven't seen something work end-to-end. 
Looking forward to pushing to heroku tonight!

*WEDNESDAY*
A slow day. Was able to push to Heroku last night, worked on validations this morning. Starting to
piece together postgres. Slow going and I'm dealing with waves of feeling overwhelmed that I'm not able to pick up 
all the pieces fast enough to be able to build these things on my own.

- Miles spoke tonight about composition and literacy, espousing the virtues of the Unix philosohpy of
"Write programs that do one thing and do it well." 
- Last night, I tried to read over Thunder. 
- AM we covered rspec and testing which was super helpful. 
- PM we got our app on Heroku - our first feature is working, the second feature isn't. Will have to debug tomorrow.
- Tonight I plan to build a lightweight app and practice rspec testing as I go along.

*WEDNESDAY*
I'm feeling overwhelmed by JS and really not feeling like much is sinking in my head this week. 
I think my brain has reached a point of exhaustion and am really trying to overcome this and not 
just blank out. 

I spent a lot of time this afternoon debugging our canvas HTML, which I'm not sure is super-helpful
right now, since I don't feel like I have a basic grasp of how javascript works yet.

*THURSDAY*

Today we went over AJAX today and I definitely need some time to figure it out. I'm getting
a little more comfortable with javascript and jquery - just enought to be aware of 
what I still need to learn, but definitely till at level 1. I feel like my focus is back 
but I'm definitely not be reaching anywhere past level 1 this week.

Today/Last night we covered: 
* Intro to APIs using Omniauth
* OO Javascript racer + OO Orange Tree - this helped me better understand jquery and OO js and interactions with the browser. 
* Bcrypt - I got tanked by this. I want to get this down tonight. 

I definitely feel more comfortable with ajax, epecially after Friday solo day where I drilled down on AJAX.

Tonight I want to move the needle on:
* Ruby for Webapps - Working through (1) bcrypt challenge and (2) figuring out .env and databases.
* Testing & TDD - Create tests while working through bcrypt challenge

Today I covered: 
* Making gem files - I felt like I understood the basic architecture.
* Making forms and using javascript and sessions.
* Read through code for authentication and validation.

I'm feeling a little more comfortable with routes. External APIs are still a myster for me though.
