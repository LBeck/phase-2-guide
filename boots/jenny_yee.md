Feeling a little better about how things are working together but still haven't seen something work end-to-end. 
Looking forward to pushing to heroku tonight!

*Phase 2 Day 3 October 9*
A slow day. Was able to push to Heroku last night, worked on validations this morning. Starting to
piece together postgres. Slow going and I'm dealing with waves of feeling overwhelmed that I'm not able to pick up 
all the pieces fast enough to be able to build these things on my own.
