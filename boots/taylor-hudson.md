I learned about Rspec testing and how to write a program in small, incremental steps with
the morning challenge. I learned more about Git through having to to deal with an
obnoxious merge conflict. I also learned about HTTP GET and POST by preparing a lightning talk.

Today I learned how to write Sinatra routes and embedded Ruby to dynamically generate
