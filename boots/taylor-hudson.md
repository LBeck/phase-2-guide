I learned some approaches to refactoring and how to use modules and include to separate
out useful functionality. I learned how to use partials with Sinatra to control what is 
displayed on a web page based on Ruby logic.

Feel like I'm getting better at reading Javascript and understanding how it passes
functions and events. Conceptually, I don't find JQuery and AJAX that hard but
there are a lot of details to keep track of.

I got a crash course in Jasmine tests and how to write Javascript constructors
with the OrangeTree exercise, and learned about how to use JS event handlers
to draw on an HTML5 canvas. I feel like I'm learning lots of little bits and pieces
about things but find it hard to see the broader picture of any one of the
technologies we're learning.

I got more practice using TDD with a partner (playing tennis) with the Game of Life, and
learned about using Shoulda Helpers to write tests for our database.

I learned about Rspec testing and how to write a program in small, incremental steps with
the morning challenge. I learned more about Git through having to to deal with an
obnoxious merge conflict. I also learned about HTTP GET and POST by preparing a lightning talk.

Today I learned how to write Sinatra routes and embedded Ruby to dynamically generate
HTML elements from a database. I also began to learn about writing Capybara tests.

I learned how to create and push a basic heroku app live, and the basic syntax of Rspec.
I also thought I (finally) got a grasp on how git branches, merges and pull requests work
(but made a mistake anyway).
