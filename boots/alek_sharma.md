Hard to tell if I was overwhelmed or just delirious/sick today. Really interfered with my ability to think on my feet     (barely on my feet, actually). Did get a primer on using file structure to organize my thoughts in Sinatra, as well as some pointers to some tutorials that should solidify RSPEC and Sinatra for me before things get too out of hand.

Much better day today. Really felt like a lot of my work was coming together and was not so lost on where to begin in the group project. I really enjoy TDD, and the learning objectives seem a bit more realistic. Am going home in a few minutes for an early night once again; really want to make sure that I've nailed my cold.

Having a really good time this week, but extremely tired. Probably still geting over whatever I had last week. Javascript is proving to be relatively tame compared to DOM manipulation and the dual monster of HTML/CSS.

Was sort of blown away by the Twitter API earlier today, but it turned out to be less complicated than I thought. Also, I am still a little unsure about my skill level when it comes to DOM interaction, jQuery, and HTML/CSS. These are my weak points, and I keep running to JavaScript to hide my ignorance. More portfolio challenges and interactive tutorial videos are definitely in store during the evenings.

Feeling good about today. I had some doubts as to whether I should continue on to Phase 3, but after talking with several fellow boots, I feel much better about my feelings of uncertainty. I think that discomfort (and feeling comfortable with discomfort) is a big part of DBC, and I didn't really have to learn that lesson in Phase 1. Putting some more time into HTML/CSS tonight; tomorrow is going to be a JS for Webapps day.
