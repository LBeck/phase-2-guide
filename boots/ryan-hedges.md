Thank you?

1. Indicate where you feel you stand in each of the learning objectives.
   (use an [emoji](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) for :+1: :gem:!)
2. Add a tweet-sized blurb about what you learned today.

### The Thumb System

Each learning objective has a series of behaviors or questions that you can use
to gauge where you sit on the thumb system. It's by no means comprehensive; and
is intended as a starting point for assessing your comprehension and competence.

* 1 thumb up indicates you're competent enough to be somewhat useful and able to
  work in it independently
* 2 means you're comfortable with the topic, and are actually productive in it
* 3 means you are zomg wtf amazi-craze you just tear through code in that topic

I learned more about heroku and github. Set up file structure for web app and migrated our Database.
Recognized opression/sexism. I wanted sinatra experience tonight but got stuck on heroku.
Practiced being more auditory by trying to explain understanding of things.
I don't feel significantly closer to learning objectives to change thumbs.
