#1 Week One, Day One
- most interesting learning was with pull requests on Github.  Hint:  check the root directory before forking!
- interested by the power of Heroku.  Still working out how to push to Heroku master (suspect that it's something to do with the directory structure, since the app is working on the local host)
- plan on continuing with RSpec and ActiveRecord for the rest of the evening.
