TDD is still like learning a new language to me.  Which means, syntax is hard for me to pick up unless I get constant repetition.
Building a skeleton is still difficult with some reference.  I'm fairly okay with what ActiveRecord does with the "easy" things
I have previous HTML & CSS experience so if you ask me to code up a photoshop file with column and grid layouts I"ll be able to do it
without some bootstrap, albeit, bootstrap does make it easy.  Most of my efforts are on testing.

Feedback is appreciated here..:

Look, I think I can code things up and look things up.  I feel comfortable at this point looking things up and doing it.
What I'm comfortable with is communicating my ideas.  My coding without looking things up is way better than before.
I don't know how to yet implement OO javascript into Dom manipulation stuff.  I can do it the other way around with out OO.
I want someone to show me how to implement OO JS with the DOM (instructors help?!).  I believe in JS the power of it.
I want to learn all the cool things like Backbone, Ember, and Angular, and Node.  Big cry for help to extend my learning here.

Other than that...Sinatra is fine, simple ActiveRecord things are is fine.  DOM stuff...with time is fine, still takes time.
OO JS is 'okay'.


Week 2 - Thursday 

AJAX was not cool.  I'm forgot the high-level concept after intercepting an AJAX request.  Not sure what to do after that.  
HELP.  Other than that, I think it's easy.
