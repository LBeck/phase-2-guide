TDD is still like learning a new language to me.  Which means, syntax is hard for me to pick up unless I get constant repetition.
Building a skeleton is still difficult with some reference.  I'm fairly okay with what ActiveRecord does with the "easy" things
I have previous HTML & CSS experience so if you ask me to code up a photoshop file with column and grid layouts I"ll be able to do it
without some bootstrap, albeit, bootstrap does make it easy.  Most of my efforts are on testing.
