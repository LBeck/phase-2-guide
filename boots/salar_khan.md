I think its hilarious that I spent my hour long spike on RSpec and I still got a 0/8 on Testing
and TDD. Also think its hilarious that I got a 6/8 on AR. I don't feel anywhere close to a 6/8.

Same scores. But I feel way better about Testing and TDD after writing a few solid Capybara tests today. 
Although that isn't saying much cause I felt awful after yesterday night's failures. About to spend the
night TDDing Pig Latin. Also pushing our todo app to Heroku felt SO. GOOD.

RSpec/TDD practice in the morning = Awesome. Linkified all the discussions on our group project -- Want to get through some CSS tutorials tonight so I can prettify our discussion board!
The 1/8 from the 2 thumbs up section comes from being able to explain new things I've learned to my team. 
Disovered some cool things with routes/redirects/.erb stuff, and I feel like I was able to clearly explain what exactly was going down.

Another fantastic day. Ping pong in the morning was one of the most fun exercises at DBC to date. Closely
followed by acting out enumerables. Except I learned way more today. Implemented a search function on our discussion board today with Ryan on our team, who we onboarded by going through every line of code. I love group projects.

Saturday was pretty awful. I felt like I made 0 progress toward JS. Had a bad case of imposter syndrome by the end of it. Sunday was much better, was able to get exercism.io up and running, TDD'd deaf grandma, and handled some socrates JS labs.

so my team decided to pick the doodle project. after feeling pretty good about JS on sunday, i felt like i was ready for a challenge like this. we decided to split up -- taylor and i spiked on using libraries like paper.js, while cricket and paul tried to search out clues for building it from scratch. my findings: libraries suck. or maybe they don't, but i have no idea wtf i'm doing so they're kinda hard to implement.

JTR and i sat down later on monday night and went through an HTML5 tutorial, broke down some code from stackoverflow about how to find the position of your mouse, and learned about how the canvas works within the context of the window. all of which helped me do my impromptu lightning talk. 

tuesday resulted in us playing with jquery for some syntactic sugar regarding eventhandlers. paul had to bounce at 4 cause he was feeling sick, which sucked. however. we got our app up onto heroku, created our sinatra routes, database, yadda yadda. super productive. i let my team know that i felt uncomfortable with what was going on underneath the jquery sugar, so i sat down at night with cricket and broke it down into raw JS, while commenting out every line of code so that paul can read it when he gets back. i feel way way way better about eventhandlers now. woop!
