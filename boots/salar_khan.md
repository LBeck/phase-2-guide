I think its hilarious that I spent my hour long spike on RSpec and I still got a 0/8 on Testing
and TDD. Also think its hilarious that I got a 6/8 on AR. I don't feel anywhere close to a 6/8.

Same scores. But I feel way better about Testing and TDD after writing a few solid Capybara tests today. 
Although that isn't saying much cause I felt awful after yesterday night's failures. About to spend the
night TDDing Pig Latin. Also pushing our todo app to Heroku felt SO. GOOD.

RSpec/TDD practice in the morning = Awesome. Linkified all the discussions on our group project -- Want to get through some CSS tutorials tonight so I can prettify our discussion board!
The 1/8 from the 2 thumbs up section comes from being able to explain new things I've learned to my team. 
Disovered some cool things with routes/redirects/.erb stuff, and I feel like I was able to clearly explain what exactly was going down.

Another fantastic day. Ping pong in the morning was one of the most fun exercises at DBC to date. Closely
followed by acting out enumerables. Except I learned way more today. Implemented a search function on our discussion board today with Ryan on our team, who we onboarded by going through every line of code. I love group projects.
