I think its hilarious that I spent my hour long spike on RSpec and I still got a 0/8 on Testing
and TDD. Also think its hilarious that I got a 6/8 on AR. I don't feel anywhere close to a 6/8.

Same scores. But I feel way better about Testing and TDD after writing a few solid Capybara tests today. 
Although that isn't saying much cause I felt awful after yesterday night's failures. About to spend the
night TDDing Pig Latin. Also pushing our todo app to Heroku felt SO. GOOD.
