Learning objectives for Phase 2: Be able to build kick-ass web applications using:
Sinatra, Heroku, RSpec, ActiveRecord, and a bunch of other software

Monday 10/7/2013: Day was pretty much of a blur trying to get back in the swing and get VM set up to run ruby. 
Tuesday 10/8/2013: Still a blur. Thanks to Topher I can run ruby on the laptop now. Yay!
                  Created ToDo list web app in the morning and first rev of discussion forum app in the afternoon.
