In the morning I re-learned some basic jQuery, but I still want to brush up on it. I may repeat the jQuery Codeschool 
course I took before DBC. In the afternoon Anne showed us how to create objects that belong to others using ActiveRecord
which was enlightening. In the evening I tried to keep working on my Game of Life JS app but didn't get very far...

Don't know what Test doubles are still. Not sure what library test mode is. Havent yet used capybara with jasmine. 
No AJAX yet either. I'd also like to practically see the difference between Oauth and Omniauth.
