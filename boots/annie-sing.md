I felt extremely lost today, but starting around 9:30, I started going through a ton of tutorials, and felt a lot better about where I was at.

I felt a lot better about today. After doing all of those tutorials, I gained a lot of confidence in my abiliites, but I stll have a lot to learn!

I felt really good about the morning challenge today. I felt like I was doing a good job at making the tests fail before proceeding.
The afternoon is also alright. It's hard working in teams, but we're trying to make it work. My pair and I managed to get some parts of a working interface up on the web.
We're getting close to having an MVP for our first release.

I've been feeling like I'm slowing down. I am afraid that I have gaps in my knowledge, but don't seem to have enough time to get through everything I want to get through.
I think I'm in a good place though overall, just a bit of self-doubt is circulating. I think that once I build something on my own, and prove that I know what's up, I'll feel better.
But for now, I like to think I'm doing alright.

Today I acutally read the learning goals, and have realized that I'm in a good place actually. I've found that the expectations I set for myself are a bit too ambitious right now.
I can't expect myself to be proficient in a language in a day or two-- hopefully somewhat comfortable, but not proficient.
So, I feel better after reading those. I am not confident in my testing though. in fact, it makes me very nervous, so I need to work on that.
