### Touch Events
* The `touchstart` and `touchmove` events allow you to gather touches on the screen and draw. 
* Xcode with IOS simulator allows you to test your code before deployment.

### Erasing
* A quick fix for erasing - draw in the same color as you background. 

### Spiking
* Don't forget to bring things back together into master on a regular basis.
