### Testing with big functions
* Need to really practice single responsibility when you are testing. 
* Each function should (really) do just one thing. 

### this = that
* The keyword `this` refers to the calling object which is linked to run time calling.  It can get messy. 

### animation with css
* It can be done with css3 - need to set for different browsers- see our css file.
