### Canvas HTML 5 
* In chrome and Safari you can use `<input type=color> ` for a built in colorpicker. 

* Updated the 'mousemove' function to slow down the sampling rate of the mouse to get smoother drawing.  If you move the mouse faster the line gets thicker. 

* Add a `mouseout` event to handle drawing when you leave the canvas.
